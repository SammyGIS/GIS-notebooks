        "\n",
        "The Dixie Fire was an enormous wildfire in Butte, Plumas, Lassen, Shasta, and Tehama Counties, California. It is named after the creek near where it started. The fire began in the Feather River Canyon near Cresta Dam on July 13, 2021, and burned 963,309 acres (389,837 ha) before being 100% contained on October 25, 2021. It was the largest single (i.e. non-complex) wildfire in recorded California history, and the second-largest wildfire overall (after the August Complex fire of 2020). The fire damaged or destroyed several small towns, including Greenville on August 4, Canyondam on August 5, and Warner Valley on August 12.\n",
        "\n",
        "By July 23, it had become the largest wildfire of the 2021 California fire season; by August 6, it had grown to become the largest single (i.e. non-complex) wildfire in the state's history, burning an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. It was the first fire known to have burned across the crest of the Sierra Nevada (followed by the Caldor Fire later in the season). Smoke from the Dixie Fire caused unhealthy air quality across the Western United States, including states as far east as Utah and Colorado.\n",
